1. Write the Pseudocode to Calculate the sum of digits of the number given by user
Eg: 456=4+5+6=15

Pseudocode

Input the number from the user.
Initialize a variable sum to 0.
While the number is greater than 0:
Get the last digit of the number (number % 10).
Add the last digit to sum.
Remove the last digit from the number (number // 10).
Output the value of sum.

Algorithm

Start
Input num
Initialize sum to 0
While num > 0, repeat steps 5 to 7:
digit = num % 10
sum = sum + digit
num = num // 10
End While
Output sum
End
Would you like a code implementation for this as well?

2. Write the Pseudocode to calcualte the area of a rectangle, square and circle


Pseudocode
Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

START
   INPUT length, width
   area <- length * width
   OUTPUT area
END

Algorithm to Calculate the Area of a Rectangle

Start
Input the length of the rectangle.
Input the width of the rectangle.
Compute the area using the formula: area = length * width.
Output the area.
End

Calculate the Area of a Square

START
   INPUT side
   area <- side * side
   OUTPUT area
END

Algorithm to Calculate the Area of a Square

Start
Input the side length of the square.
Compute the area using the formula: area = side * side.
Output the area.
End

Calculate the Area of a Circle

START
   INPUT radius
   area <- 3.14 * radius * radius
   OUTPUT area
END

Algorithm to Calculate the Area of a Circle

Start
Input the radius of the circle.
Compute the area using the formula: area = 3.14 * radius * radius.
Output the area.
End

3.Write the Pseudocode to calculate the average of 5 marks accepted from user. If the average is between 75-90 print excellent, 
60-75 print good and 45-60 pass below 45 fail

Pseudocode:

Start
   Initialize sum to 0

   For i from 1 to 5 do
      Prompt user to enter mark i
      Read mark i
      Add mark i to sum
   End For

   Calculate average = sum / 5

   If average >= 75 and average <= 90 then
      Print "Excellent"
   Else If average >= 60 and average < 75 then
      Print "Good"
   Else If average >= 45 and average < 60 then
      Print "Pass"
   Else
      Print "Fail"
   End If
End

Algorithm:
Start
Initialize sum to 0
For i from 1 to 5:
Prompt the user to enter mark i
Read mark i
Add mark i to sum
Calculate average as sum / 5
If average is between 75 and 90 (inclusive):
Print "Excellent"
Else if average is between 60 and 75 (exclusive):
Print "Good"
Else if average is between 45 and 60 (exclusive):
Print "Pass"
Else:
Print "Fail"
End
